Differential Evolution for Multimode Interferometer

This notebook demonstrates an evolutionary algorithm applied to optimizing an experiment.

The **Differential_Evolution.ipynb**, contains the script used to optimize at each port. 

We provide the modules needed to control:
    * laser (ANDO AQ4321) 
    * detector (Keysight N7744A) 
    * source/measure device (Qontrol (http://qontrol.co.uk))
