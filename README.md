Differential Evolution for Multimode Interferometer

This notebook demonstrates an evolutionary algorithm applied to optimizing an experiment.

The **Differential_Evolution.ipynb**, contains the script used to optimize at each port. 

We provide the modules needed to control the laser(ANDO AQ4321), detector(Keysight N7744A) and source/measure devices (Qontrol (http://qontrol.co.uk)).
